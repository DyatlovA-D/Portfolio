### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### My name is Anna and I am Data Analyst ðŸ’»

Here, you can check out the projects I've completed during my additional professional education in Data Analysis. The table of contents and links can be found below.

This page will definitely be updated with more projects as I continue to develop my skills. For now, if you've already familiarized yourself with all of them, just enjoy this beautiful aesthetic picture here and have a great day! ðŸ˜‰
